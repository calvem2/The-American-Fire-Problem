    <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
    <em>Since we were measuring and comparing the number of fires per 10k acres across the United
        States, we decided to display our data findings with an interactive U.S. map using the
        Albers projection so that distortion is minimal between the standard parallels. In
        addition, we paired it with a line chart in order to provide more information of how the
        number of fires have changed throughout time starting from 1992 to 2015. <br> <br>

        Starting with the U.S. map, we decided to go with the interactivity of allowing the user
        to click each state that they're interested in and it will trigger a pan zoom-in effect
        to get a closer look into the states' specific locations of where the fires are occurring.
        Once zoomed in, we have little markers to show the fires' location which we decided to
        include because then you could identify certain clusters within that specific state. The
        zoom functions also add a nice easability to the visualization and its purpose is to show the
        user that they're now looking at one specific state's data rather than the entirety of the country. <br> <br>

        We also include some tooltips so that the user can gain even more information when they perform
        a mouseover. Including this allows for a bit more subtle information that can be quickly
        accessible. Having it be a mouseover is also nice for when you're zoomed in and you want
        to look at a specific fire marker and there isn't some distracting big table that displays
        the information, rather you get it right where your mouse is. <br><br>

        The colors of each state is based on a color spectrum range starting at yellow with the
        lesser number of fires per acre to red representing the more number of fires per acre. We
        decided to use this color because hotter temperatures are normally portrayed with a red
        high in contrast, and a lower temperature, but still hot, is normally seen as a lighter yellow.
        We wanted the colors to be intuitive with our idea of fires. <br><br>

        Next, we also have the use of a line chart to combine with our map visualization. We wanted to
        include this because we thought it would help individuals visually see how the number of fires per
        acre change throughout the years. It's easier to see it graphed out, rather than just on a color
        spectrum. The line chart corresponds to the year that the slider is set to, along with the state
        once a state is clicked. It also has a dynamic y-axis because each state has a different interval
        of the number of fires that it has. We include that transition of the y-axis changing so that it's
        clear to the user that it has been modified. The line chart is just a static red color to just represent the fires. <br><br>

        Lastly, the overall style of the website is simple so that it is clear to the user what they're
        main focus should be on. We also wanted to make the background fit a more "dark-mode" theme so
        that the harsh colors of the yellow-red spectrum would pop out more to the user!
