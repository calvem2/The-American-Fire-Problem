    <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
    <em>
        Our dataset contains records of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 
        2015 acquired by the U.S. Forest Service from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local
        fire organizations. We excluded fires that were less than 0.5 acres in size in order to focus on
        more substantial wildfires.<br><br>

        Since we were measuring and comparing the number of fires per 10k acres across the United
        States, we decided to display our data findings with an interactive U.S. map using the
        Albers projection so that distortion is minimal between the standard parallels. In
        addition, we paired it with a line chart in order to provide more information of how the
        number of fires have changed throughout time starting from 1992 to 2015. <br> <br>

        Starting with the U.S. map, we decided to go with the interactivity of allowing the user
        to click each state that they're interested in and it will trigger a pan zoom-in effect
        to get a closer look into the states' specific locations of where the fires are occurring.
        Once zoomed in, we have little markers to show the fires' location which we decided to
        include because then you could identify certain clusters within that specific state. The
        zoom functions also add a nice easability to the visualization and its purpose is to show the
        user that they're now looking at one specific state's data rather than the entirety of the country. <br> <br>

        Additionally, we added a slider that enables scrubbing between years to enable exploration of wildfires 
        across time. This allows the user to compare the total area burned across all the states over the years 
        when the map is zoomed out. If the user has selected a state, scrubbing between the years adjusts the 
        markers shown for the individual fires. <br><br>

        We also include some tooltips so that the user can gain even more information when they perform
        a mouseover. Including this allows for a bit more subtle information that can be quickly
        accessible. Having it be a mouseover is also nice for when you're zoomed in and you want
        to look at a specific fire marker and there isn't some distracting big table that displays
        the information, rather you get it right where your mouse is. <br><br>

        The colors of each state is based on a color spectrum range starting at yellow with the
        lesser number of fires per acre to red representing the more number of fires per acre. We
        decided to use this color because hotter temperatures are normally portrayed with a red
        high in contrast, and a lower temperature, but still hot, is normally seen as a lighter yellow.
        We wanted the colors to be intuitive with our idea of fires. <br><br>

        Next, we also have the use of a line chart to combine with our map visualization. We wanted to
        include this because we thought it would help individuals visually see how the number of fires per
        acre change throughout the years. It's easier to see it graphed out, rather than just on a color
        spectrum. The line chart corresponds to the year that the slider is set to, along with the state
        once a state is clicked. It also has a dynamic y-axis because each state has a different interval
        of the number of fires that it has. We include that transition of the y-axis changing so that it's
        clear to the user that it has been modified. The line chart is just a static red color to just represent the fires. <br><br>

        Lastly, the overall style of the website is simple so that it is clear to the user what they're
        main focus should be on. We also wanted to make the background fit a more "dark-mode" theme so
        that the harsh colors of the yellow-red spectrum would pop out more to the user!

    <h2>Development Process</h2>
    <em>[Add: describe how the work was split among the team members.
      Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions:
      Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)?
      What aspects took the most time?]

            For this project I spent the majority of my time working on the map of the United States and getting familiar with D3. Megan 
            and I implemented the basic features of the map (drawing the map, zooming into a state on click, filtering the data so the 
            circles are only drawn for the state that is clicked etc..). I also added the coloring to the states so that when the slider selects 
            a given year, then the state colors update accordingly based on the data for the given year. This part probably took the most time 
            for me because throughout the course of the project there were numerous discussions on how we should be coloring the states and how 
            many color buckets there should be, so every time a decision was made I had to go in and update the code. I would also have to go 
            in and update the tooltip for a given state to display the correct data values. I was also able to give feedback to Anne 
            while she was picking out what colors to use for the states. I'm glad that I spent the majority of the project working in D3 
            so that I will be well prepared for the final project.

            Over the course of the project I utilized my knowledge of Python, specifically pandas and numpy to assess the
            data quality of our datasets, as well as connect data together from different sources to build some of our underlying datasets.
            For example in order to get our land burned per 10,000 acres table I had to connect two tables, our original fire dataset
            containing wildfire sizes, as well as a smaller dataset containing the acreage of each state. From there I aggregated and joined
            the data, cleaning as I went. While this work was tricky at times there was less new elements to it than the work I did in d3,
            specifically working on the tooltips for our map. I had not worked in javascript before so the learning curve was the aspect
            that took the most time for me.
